My name is Patrice, I'm passionate about new techs like cloud services, containerization, automation, blockchain, AI.

I was born and raised in Paris, France. Two years ago, I decided to move to Toronto, Canada to improve my english, and also discover a new culture.

I like to work with people and teach them what I know, and I love to learn from other as well. We always learn in this field, and until I'll get bored of this, I'm gonna continue to fill my head as much as possible :)

Other than work, I've got a passion for everything around Japan. I used to play a lot on FPS games, but now my favorite thing is just enjoy the time with friends and family.
