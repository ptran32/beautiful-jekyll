My name is Patrice, I'm passionate about new techs like cloud services, containerization, automation, blockchain, AI.

I was born and raised in Paris, France. Two years ago, I've decided to move to Toronto, Canada because I wanted to improve my english, and also discover a new culture.

I like to work with people and help them to get better, and the reverse is true when people teach me new stuffs. We always learn in this field, and until I'll get bored of this, I'm gonna continue to fill my head as much as possible :)
