Iterm2 + vim + zsh + vscode is all I need

Here's my everyday setup, it's always more confortable to work with tools that make your life easier :)

Below the brew packages I use:

- wget
- curl

- ssh-copy-id
- md5sha1sum
- tree
- vim
- packer
- ranger
- yq
- minikube
- jq
- httpie
- exa
- ccat
- kube-ps1
- zsh
- k9s

## [Ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

For better auto-completion, alias and display.

Below the plugins that I use:

- git
- z
- aws
- extract
- colorize
- virtualenv
- zsh_reload
- copyfile
- copydir
- kube-ps1
- kubectl
- vault

## [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Here some extensions that I've found usefull:

- Github Dark Theme or Shades of purple theme
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- Better Comments
- Ansible
- Django
- Kubernetes
- docs-preview
- Gitlens
- Hashicorp Terraform
- Indent-rainbow
- Project manager
- Pylance
- vscode-spotify
- whitespace+
- YAML

Take also a look at [https://www.kite.com/](https://www.kite.com/) for auto completion and suggestion for Python code.

I personnaly switched to [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) as I found it less cpu intensive.

## [Spacevim](https://spacevim.org/)

This project is amazing, you've got all what you'll need from vim.

I hope that it gaves you ideas for your setup.
